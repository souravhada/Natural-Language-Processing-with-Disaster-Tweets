# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

This project aims to analyze tweets to determine whether they are related to real disasters or not. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project classifies tweets into two categories: disaster tweets and non-disaster tweets. This is useful for emergency response teams to monitor situations and respond appropriately based on real-time data from social media.

Currently working on this Project, will update shortly
